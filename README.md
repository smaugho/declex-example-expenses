# DecleX Example App: Expenses manager

In this example, all the following [DecleX](https://github.com/smaugho/declex) features are used:

* Populating and Recollecting.
* Validation of data when Recollecting from the User Interface.
* Connecting to a back-end server using OAuth 2.0.
* Using Actions in the methods.
* Using LocalDBModel to operate over the Local DB (SQLite, ActiveAndroid ORM)

The application it is basically an expenses manager, where after registered, the user can Create Expenses, Edit and Remove them. Also the expenses can be filtered through different queries to the DataBase. All the data is synchronized with the back-end Server, and the user it is able to Edit his profile.

Written 100% with DecleX it demostrate how powerful can be the framework to easily make an application with already some grade of complexity.

Feel free to contribute to this example, or propose new ones for [DecleX Framework](https://github.com/smaugho/declex).
